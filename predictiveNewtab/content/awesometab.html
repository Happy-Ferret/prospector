  <p>About</p>

  <p>The Predictive Newtab add-on is designed to help point you towards websites that may of of interest to you based on what you are currently browsing. These decisions are made entirely in your browser based on history and no personal data is sent to the web.</p>
  <p>There are two tables - the first is meant to show places that are more likely to be "home" pages for websites while the second is all other retrieved relevant results. The former is called a "hub".</p>

  <p>BM Engine: This indicates that the result was retrieved by matching on tagged bookmarks. In general, if you have well tagged bookmarks, these results are likely to be better.</p>
